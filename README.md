# Derek Baker README

## Purpose of this document
Communication is hard, but effective communication is one of _the_ most important factors for a healthy team. This document provides an insight into my mind, and how I work.

## Working Hours
I get in to work between 9:30am and 10:00am, and aim to be out the door by no later than 6.30pm.

I'm a big fan of taking breaks and making sure I have my lunch. I usually have lunch with someone or with a group of people and enjoy taking walks to help clear my head.

I have Slack and emails on my phone usually but will only respond to messages during working hours.

## Reaching me
I'm a big fan of face to face interaction. If you need me then please just pop over and see me, but I understand that isn't possible all of the time so I am always available on Slack.

I check my emails constantly unfortunately so I can always be reached if necessary.

I am always happy to have a Slack Call, Google Hangout or Zoom meeting if we plan it in advance; even if that planning is as simple as sending a Slack message "Hey, can we have a quick call about XYZ" the answer will either be "I'm free now!" or "I'll be free at ${time}!"


## Meetings
If the outcome of a meeting can be communicated or decided in an email or Slack conversation I would prefer we didn't have the meeting.

I am quite protective of my time, so if I am not required to attend a meeting you've invited me to, please let me know.

## Feedback

I always encourage feedback and actively seek it from my peers. I am constantly looking to grow so please feel free to contact me via whichever channel makes you more comfortable.

I am actively working on improving my delivery when it comes to giving feedback, as I've been told I can be a bit too harsh at times. Please feel free to pull me and tell me that you didn't like the way I delivered and what I could've done better to deliver my feedback.

## I am actively trying to avoid, and would appreciate being called out if you see me:
- Not using inclusive language (ie. saying 'Guys' rather than 'Folks')
- Talking over others
- Interrupting whilst other people are talking
- Talking down about myself or my skills
- Overextending myself
